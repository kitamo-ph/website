## `/how-it-works`

The page has five steps, with the screens noted:

1. Set up your business and choose a language.
2. Add your paninda (P3).
3. Sell (P1, P2). The sukli line describes the keypad and Sakto, which
   production has today. It does not describe the branch-only quick-cash keys.
4. Gastos and Utang (P5, P4).
5. Kita (T1, P6).

The page ends with "What KitaMo doesn't do":

- it needs internet;
- it records payments but doesn't move money;
- the receipt is not an official BIR receipt.

Claims: CLM-013 to 020, 022, 023, 026. (Hotfix 2026-10-20: "there are no staff
logins or multiple stalls yet" removed and CLM-024 retired, because staff
sign-in and stalls are live in the web app. Removal only; no claim added.)

## `/for-sellers`

The page has five blocks, one per intended context. Each block has three
"uses" lines that restate CLM-016 to CLM-020. The karinderia block carries the
S2 illustration with the photo caption.

This page must not mention:

- recipe costing;
- adoption or "trusted by";
- outcomes.

## `/about`

- **What KitaMo is.** Claims CLM-011 and CLM-016 to CLM-020.
- **Why.** The tagline and the lista explanation, plus the formula.
- **Where it stands.** Two rows:
  - Web app, **Available Today**: "Free while in testing … any future charge
    is announced first and needs your agreement" (CLM-011, CLM-012).
  - Android app, offline, **Currently Testing**: "Not yet available"
    (CLM-002, 003, 006).
- **Need help?** Links to `app.kitamo.online/support` (CLM-025).
- **Close.** "Try it at your counter." with the primary action.

## Exclusions on every route

Every route must leave out:

- statistics, testimonials, ratings, customer counts, partners, awards,
  urgency;
- pricing tiers;
- offline claims for the web app;
- payment processing, BIR compliance, AI;
- staff or multi-stall availability;
- a download action;
- real brand names or logos in images;
- people presented as real KitaMo users.

The tests in `tests/components/` enforce the link allow-list, the primary and
secondary actions, the banned phrases, the Android wording and the receipt
arithmetic.

## Revalidation

Revalidate this contract in any of these cases:

- a `seller-web` release changes a pictured screen or a claimed capability;
- sign-up, the login route or the Terms' testing clause changes;
- a new route, image or language is added;
- before first publication, against the ADR-0012 launch gate.
